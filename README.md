The analysis will use the Census Adult Income dataset, which provides extensive demographic and employment-related information about individuals. Logistic regression and SVM are well-established machine learning models that are commonly used for binary classification tasks. Predicting income level is a crucial task for individuals, organizations, and governments alike. By accurately predicting income level based on demographic and employment-related attributes, this analysis can help identify key factors that affect income level and improve decision-making around issues such as poverty reduction and social mobility. The analysis will be completed within a reasonable time frame, with a focus on ensuring that results are accurate and robust. The timeline will include data preprocessing, EDA, model training and evaluation, and final reporting of results.

In summary, this analysis will use SMART methodologies to predict income level based on demographic and employment-related attributes in the Census Adult Income dataset. By using well-established machine learning models and evaluating model performance using multiple metrics, the analysis will provide valuable insights into the key factors that affect income level and identify the most accurate model for predicting income level.
